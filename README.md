This is a User vs. Computer "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game, which I created after practicing Dave Gray's JS Tutorial for Beginners #1 through #15.
___________________________________
To Run This Game in Windows:
1. Download these files and open them in VSC with the Live Server extension
2. Open a Chrome Browser (about:blank)
3. Use ctrl + shift + J to open the console
4. Click on "Go Live" at the bottom of VSC
5. The first game will automatically display in the console.
6. To "play" again, refresh the browser.

Game Creation Notes:

I borrowed the ternary operator conditionals code and more from My First Interactive JS Rock, Paper, Scissors Game. Following the tutorial, I added arrays to it.

Problem-solving: I learned to github a new origin repository without deleting anything here: https://devconnected.com/how-to-change-git-remote-origin/

Problem unsolved: 

Feedback changes: 

Future adjustments from Feedback: I am looking into learning how to add SweetAlert (https://sweetalert2.github.io/) to create pop-up boxes with style and larger text. I may use an overlay method as in the JS Tic Tac Toe project I completed with Web Dev Simplified's Tutorial.
