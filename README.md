This is a User vs. Computer "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game, which I created after practicing Dave Gray's JS Tutorial for Beginners #1 through #15.

Game Creation Notes:

I borrowed the ternary operator conditionals code and more from My First Interactive JS Rock, Paper, Scissors Game. Following the tutorial, I added arrays to it.

Problem-solving: I learned to github a new origin repository without deleting anything here: https://devconnected.com/how-to-change-git-remote-origin/

This tutorial was an overview of different scripts to overhaul our code. First, I copied each of the version's code into 3 files, labeled script1.js, etc. Then, I tested each of them by changing the script location on the html. I decided what I liked from each, modified it into my own code, and created this refactored Rock, Paper, Scissors Game.

Problem unsolved: 

Feedback changes: 

Future adjustments from Feedback: I am looking into learning how to add SweetAlert (https://sweetalert2.github.io/) to create pop-up boxes with style and larger text. I may use an overlay method as in the JS Tic Tac Toe project I completed with Web Dev Simplified's Tutorial.
